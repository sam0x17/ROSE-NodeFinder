/** Returns instruction kind for any architecture.

 *  Instruction kinds are specific to the architecture so it doesn't make sense to compare an instruction kind from x86 with an
 *  instruction kind from m68k.  However, this virtual function exists so that we don't need to implement switch statements
 *  every time we want to compare two instructions from the same architecture.  For instance, instead of code like this:
 *
 * @code
 *  bool areSame(SgAsmInstruction *a, SgAsmInstruction *b) {
 *      if (a->variantT() != b->variantT())
 *          return false;
 *      if (SgAsmM68kInstruction *aa = isSgAsmM68kInstruction(a)) {
 *          SgAsmM68kInstruction *bb = isSgAsmM68kInstruction(b);
 *          return aa->get_kind() == bb->get_kind();
 *      }
 *      if (SgAsmMipsInstruction *aa = isSgAsmMipsInstruction(a)) {
 *          SgAsmMipsInstruction *bb = isSgAsmMipsInstruction(b);
 *          return aa->get_kind() == bb->get_kind();
 *      }
 *      ...
 *      ... // and many others
 *      ...
 *      ASSERT_not_reachable("architecture is not implemented yet");
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *  we can write future-proof code:
 *
 * @code
 *  bool areSame(SgAsmInstruction *a, SgAsmInstruction *b) {
 *      return a->variantT()==b->variantT() && a->get_anyKind()==b->get_anyKind();
