/** Base class for adjusting basic blocks during discovery.
 *
 *  User-defined basic block callbacks are invoked as each instruction is discovered for a basic block. See @ref
 *  Partitioner::discoverBasicBlock for details.
 *
 *  One of the important uses for basic block callbacks is to adjust the control flow successors for a basic block.  As each
 *  instruction of a basic block is discovered the partitioner calculates its control flow successors to decide what to do.
 *  The successors are calculated by evaluating the basic block instructions in a symbolic domain, and if that fails, by
 *  looking at the final instruction's concrete successors.  Once these successors are obtained, the partitioner invokes user
 *  callbacks so that the user has a chance to make adjustments. By time this callback is invoked, the basic block's initial
 *  successors have been computed and cached in the basic block. That list can be obtained by invoking @ref
 *  Partitioner::basicBlockSuccessors (or similar) or by accessing the @ref BasicBlock::successors cache directly. Likewise,
 *  the successor list can be adjusted by invoking methods in the partitioner API or by modifying the cache directly.
 *
 *  Another important use for these callbacks is to tell the partitioner when a basic block is finished.  The partitioner has a
 *  fairly long list of criteria that it uses as documented in @ref Partitioner::discoverBasicBlock.  One of these criteria is
 *  to look at the <code>args.results.termination</code> enum returned by the callbacks: if it is TERMINATE_NOW or
 *  TERMINATE_PRIOR then the block is forcibly terminated regardless of what would have otherwise happened.
 *
 *  The partitioner expects callbacks to have shared ownership and references them only via Sawyer::SharedPointer.  Therefore,
 *  subclasses should implement an @c instance class method that allocates a new object and returns a shared pointer. */
