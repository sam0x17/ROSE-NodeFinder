/** Partitions instructions into basic blocks and functions.
 *
 *  A partitioner is responsible for driving a disassembler to obtain instructions, grouping those instructions into basic
 *  blocks, grouping the basic blocks into functions, and building an abstract syntax tree.
 *
 *  The following objects are needed as input:
 *
 * @li A memory map containing the memory for the specimen being analyzed.  Parts of memory that contain instructions must be
 *     mapped with execute permission.  Parts of memory that are readable and non-writable will be considered constant for the
 *     purpose of disassembly and partitioning and can contain things like dynamic linking tables that have been initialized
 *     prior to calling the partitioner.
 *
 * @li A disassembler which is canonical for the specimen architecture and which will return an instruction (possibly an
 *     "unknown" instruction) whenever it is asked to disassemble an address that is mapped with execute permission.  The
 *     partitioner wraps the disassembler and memory map into an InstructionProvider that caches disassembled instructions.
 *
 *  The following data structures are maintained consistently by the partitioner (described in detail later):
 *
 *  @li A control flow graph (CFG) indicating the basic blocks that will become part of the final abstract syntax tree (AST).
 *      The CFG is highly fluid during partitioning, with basic blocks and control flow edges being added and removed.  Since
 *      basic blocks are composed of instructions, the CFG indirectly represents the instructions that will become the AST.
 *
 *  @li An address usage map (AUM), which is a mapping from every address represented in the CFG to the instruction(s) and
 *      their basic blocks.  A single address may have multiple overlapping instructions (although this isn't the usual case),
 *      and every instruction represented by the map belongs to exactly one basic block that belongs to the CFG.
 *
 *  @li Various work lists.  Most built-in work lists are represented by special vertices in the CFG.  For instance, the
 *      "nonexisting" vertex has incoming edges from all basic blocks whose first instruction is not in executable-mapped
 *      memory.  The built-in worklists are unordered, but users can maintain their own worklists that are notified whenever
 *      instructions are added to or erased from the CFG.
 *
 * @section basic_block Basic Blocks
 *
 *  A basic block (BB) is a sequence of distinct instructions that are always executed linearly from beginning to end with no
 *  branching into or out of the middle of the BB.  The semantics of a BB are the composition of the semantics of each
 *  instruction in the order they would be executed.  The instructions of a BB are not required to be contiguous in memory,
 *  although they usually are.
 *
 *  A basic block has a starting address (equivalent to the starting address of its first instruction when its first
 *  instruction is known), and a size measured in instructions.  A basic block's size in bytes is generally not useful since
 *  there is no requirement that the instructions be contiguous in memory.  Basic blocks also store the results of various
 *  analyses that are run when the block is created.
 *
 *  Basic blocks can either be represented in a partitioner's CFG/AUM, or they can exist in a detached state.  Basic blocks in
 *  a detached state can be modified directly via BasicBlock methods, but blocks that are attached to the CFG/AUM are
 *  frozen. Frozen blocks can still be modified in certain ways, but usually only by going through the Partitioner API that
 *  ensures that the CFG/AUM are kept up-to-date.  The CFG/AUM will contain at most one basic block per basic block starting
 *  address.
 *
 *  If the first instruction of a basic block is unmapped or mapped without execute permission then the basic block is said to
 *  be non-existing and will have no instructions.  Such blocks point to the special "nonexisting" CFG vertex when they are
 *  attached to the control flow graph. If a non-initial instruction of a basic block is unmapped or not executable then the
 *  prior instruction becomes the final instruction of the block and the block's successor will be a vertex for a non-existing
 *  basic block which in turn points to the special "nonexisting" CFG vertex.  In other words, a basic block will either
 *  entirely exist or entirely not exist (there are no basic blocks containing instructions that just run off the end of
 *  memory).
 *
 *  If a basic block encounters an address which is mapped with execute permission and properly aligned but the instruction
 *  provider is unable to disassemble an instruction at that address, then the instruction provider must provide an "unknown"
 *  instruction. Since an "unknown" instruction always has indeterminate edges it becomes the final instruction of the basic
 *  block, and the CFG will contain an edge to the special "indeterminate" vertex.  Blocks that have improper alignment are
 *  treated as if they started at an unmapped or non-executable address.
 *
 * @section data_block Data Blocks
 *
 *  A data block is an address and data type anywhere in memory.  A data block can be attached to a CFG/AUM, or exist in a
 *  detached state. They are attached to the CFG/AUM by virtue of being owned by one or more basic blocks or functions that are
 *  attached to the CFG/AUM. Data blocks such as function alignment are typically attached to a function, while data blocks
 *  such as branch tables are typically attached to a basic block.  A data block may be attached to more than one function
 *  and/or basic block, and the CFG/AUM is able to support multiple data blocks having the same address.
 *
 * @section functions Functions
 *
 *  A function is a collection of one or more basic blocks related by control flow edges.  One basic block is special in that
 *  it serves as the only entry point to this function for inter-function edges (usually function calls).  Any edge that leaves
 *  the function must enter a different function's entry block.  These two rules can be relaxed, but result in a control flow
 *  graph that is not proper for a function--most of ROSE's analyses work only on proper control flow graphs.
 *
 *  Functions can either be represented in a partitioner's CFG/AUM, or they can exist in a detached state.  Functions in a
 *  detached state can have their basic block and data block ownership adjusted, otherwise the function exists in a frozen
 *  state to prevent the CFG/AUM from becoming out of date with respect to the function.  Frozen functions can only be modified
 *  through the Partitioner API so that the CFG/AUM can be updated.  When a function becomes detached from the CFG it thaws out
 *  again and can be modified.  The CFG/AUM will contain at most one function per function starting address.
 *
 * @section cfg Control Flow Graph
 *
 *  At any point in time, the partitioner's control flow graph represents those basic blocks (and indirectly the instructions)
 *  that have been selected to appear in the final abstract syntax tree (AST).  This is a subset of all basic blocks ever
 *  created, and a subset of the instructions known to the instruction provider. Note: a final pass during AST construction
 *  might join certain CFG vertices into a single SgAsmBlock under certain circumstances.
 *
 *  Most CFG vertices are either basic block placeholders, or the basic blocks themselves (pointers to BasicBlock objects).  A
 *  placeholder is a basic block starting address without a pointer to an object, and always has exactly one outgoing edge to
 *  the special "undiscovered" vertex.
 *
 *  The CFG has a number of special vertices that don't correspond to a particular address or basic block:
 *
 *  @li "Undiscovered" is a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges originate from placeholder vertices.
 *
 *  @li "Nonexisting" is a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges originate from basic blocks that were discovered to have
 *      an unmapped or non-executable starting address.
 *
 *  @li "Function return" is a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges represent a basic block that is a
 *      return-from-function. Such vertices do not have an edge to the special "indeterminate" vertex.
 *
 *  @li "Indeterminate" is a unique, special vertex whose incoming edges originate from basic blocks whose successors
 *      are not completely known (excluding function returns). Vertices that point to the "indeterminate" vertex might also
 *      point to basic block vertices. For instance, an indirect branch through a memory location which is not mapped or is
 *      mapped with write permission will have an edge to the "indeterminate" vertex.  Unknown instructions (which indicate
 *      that the memory is executable but where the instruction provider could not disassemble anything) have only one edge,
 *      and it points to the "indeterminate" vertex.
 *
 *  CFG vertices representing function calls (i.e., the basic block is marked as being a function call) have an outgoing edge
 *  to the called function if known, and also an outgoing edge to the return point if known and reachable. These edges are
 *  labeled as calls and returns.  CFG vertices representing a function return have a single outgoing edge to the "function
 *  return" CFG vertex. Other vertices with an outgoing inter-function branch are not special (e.g., thunks).
 *
 *  @section fix FIXME[Robb P. Matzke 2014-08-03] 
 *
 *  The partitioner operates in three major phases: CFG-discovery, where basic blocks are discovered and added to the CFG;
 *  function-discovery, where the CFG is partitioned into functions; and AST-building, where the final ROSE abstract syntax
 *  tree is constructed.  The paritioner exposes a low-level API for users that need fine-grained control, and a high-level API
 *  where more things are automated.
 *
 *  During the CFG-discovery phase
 *
 * @section recursion Recursive Disassembly
 *
 *  Recursive disassembly is implemented by processing the "undiscovered" worklist (the vertices with edges to the special
 *  "undiscovered" vertex) until it is empty.  Each iteration obtains a basic block starting address from a placeholder vertex,
 *  creates a BasicBlock object and appends instructions to it until some block termination condition is reached, and inserts
 *  the new basic block into the CFG.  The worklist becoming empty is an indication that the recursion is complete.
 *
 *  The CFG may have orphaned basic blocks (blocks with no incoming edges) which can be recursively removed if desired.
 *  Orphans are created from the addresses that were manually placed on the "undiscovered" worklist and which are not the
 *  target of any known branch.  Orphans can also be created as the CFG evolves.
 *
 * @section linear Linear Disassembly
 *
 *  Linear disassembly can be approximated by running recursive disassembly repeatedly.  Each iteration adds the lowest unused
 *  executable address as a placeholder in the CFG and then runs the recursive disassembly.  Pure linear disassembly does not
 *  use control flow graphs, does not build basic blocks or functions, and is best done by calling the instruction provider or
 *  disassembler directly--it is trivial, there is no need to use a partitioner for this (see linearDisassemble.C in the
 *  projects/BinaryAnalysisTools directory).
 *
 * @section prioritizing Prioritizing Work
 *
 *  A prioritized worklist can be created by using any criteria available to the user.  Such worklists can be created from a
 *  combination of the special vertices (e.g., "undiscovered"), user-defined worklists, searching through the instruction
 *  address map, searching through the memory map, searching through the instruction provider, etc.  The partitioner provides
 *  hooks for tracking when basic blocks and edges are added to or erased from the CFG if the user needs this information to
 *  keep his worklists updated.
 *
 * @section provisional Provisional Detection
 *
 *  Sometimes one wants to ask the question "does a recursive disassembly starting at some particular address look reasonable?"
 *  and avoid making any changes if it doesn't.  This can be accomplished by creating a second "provisional" partitioner which
 *  is either in its initial empty state or a copy of the current partitioner, running the query, and examining the result.
 *  If the result looks reasonable, then the provisional partitioner can be assigned to the current partitioner.
 *
 *  When a partitioner is copied (by the copy constructor or by assignment) it makes a new copy of the CFG and the address
 *  mapping.  The new copy points to the same instructions and basic blocks as the original, but since both of these items are
 *  constant (other than basic block analysis results) they are sharing read-only information.
 *
 *  The cost of copying the CFG is linear in the number of vertices and edges.  The cost of copying the address map is linear
 *  in the number of instructions (or slightly more if instructions overlap).
 *
 *  A more efficient mechanism might be developed in the future.
 *
 * @section functions Function Boundary Determination
 *
 *  Eventually the CFG construction phase of the partitioner will complete, and then the task of partitioning the basic blocks
 *  into functions begins. During function partitioning phase, the CFG is static -- basic blocks, instructions, and edges are
 *  neither inserted nor removed. [FIXME[Robb P. Matzke 2014-07-30]: to be written later] */

     *  Obtains a basic block and its instructions without modifying the control flow graph.  If the basic block already exists
     *  in the CFG/AUM then that block is returned, otherwise a new block is created but not added to the CFG/AUM. A basic
     *  block is created by adding one instruction at a time until one of the following conditions is met (tested in this
     *  order):
     *
     *  @li An instruction could not be obtained from the instruction provider via @ref discoverInstruction. The instruction
     *      provider should return null only if the address is not mapped with execute permission or is improperly aligned for
     *      the architecture.  The basic block's final instruction is the previous instruction, if any.  If the block is empty
     *      then it is said to be non-existing, and will have a special successor when added to the CFG.
     *
     *  @li The instruction is an "unknown" instruction. The instruction provider returns an unknown instruction if it isn't
     *      able to disassemble an instruction at the specified address but the address is mapped with execute permission and
     *      the address was properly aligned.  The partitioner treats this "unknown" instruction as a valid instruction with
     *      indeterminate successors and no semantics.
     *
     *  @li Note: at this point the user-defined basic block successors callbacks are invoked. They can query characteristics
     *      of the basic block, adjust the basic block successor cache and other characteristics of the block, and write values
     *      into a results structure that is used by some of the subsequent block termination conditions.
     *
     *  @li The instruction has a concrete successor address that is an address of a non-initial instruction in this
     *      block. Basic blocks cannot have a non-initial instruction with more than one incoming edge, therefore we've already
     *      added too many instructions to this block.  We could proceed two ways: (A) We could throw away this instruction
     *      with the back-edge successor and make the block terminate at the previous instruction. This causes the basic block
     *      to be as big as possible for as long as possible, which is a good thing if it is determined later that the
     *      instruction with the back-edge is not reachable anyway. (B) We could truncate the basic block at the back-edge
     *      target so that the instruction prior to that is the final instruction. This is good because it converges to a
     *      steady state faster, but could result in basic blocks that are smaller than optimal. (The current algorithm uses
     *      method A.)
     *
     *  @li The user-defined basic block callbacks indicated that the block should be terminated.  If the successors set the @c
     *      terminate member of the @c results output argument to @ref BasicBlockCallback::TERMINATE_NOW or @ref
     *      BasicBlockCallback::TERMINATE_PRIOR, then the current instruction either becomes the final instruction of the basic
     *      block, or the prior instruction becomes the final instruction.
     *
     *  @li The instruction causes this basic block to look like a function call.  This instruction becomes the final
     *      instruction of the basic block and when the block is inserted into the CFG/AUM the edge will be marked as a
     *      function call edge.  Function call instructions typically have one successor (the target function, usually
     *      concrete, but sometimes indeterminate), but the partitioner may eventually insert a "return" edge into the CFG when
     *      this basic block is attached.
     *
     *  @li The instruction doesn't have exactly one successor. Basic blocks cannot have a non-final instruction that branches,
     *      so this instruction becomes the final instruction.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is not a constant. If the successor cannot be resolved to a constant then this
     *      instruction becomes the final instruction.  If this basic block is eventually attached to the CFG/AUM then an edge
     *      to the special "indeterminate" vertex will be created.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is the starting address for the block on which we're working. A basic block's
     *      instructions are distinct by definition, so this instruction becomes the final instruction for the block.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is the starting address of a basic block already in the CFG. This is a common case and
     *      probably means that what we discovered earlier is correct.
     *
     *  @li The instruction successor is an instruction already in the CFG other than in the conflict block.  A "conflict
     *      block" is the basic block, if any, that contains as a non-first instruction the first instruction of this block. If
     *      the first instruction of the block being discovered is an instruction in the middle of some other basic block in
     *      the CFG, then we allow this block to use some of the same instructions as in the conflict block and we do not
     *      terminate construction of this block at this time. Usually what happens is the block being discovered uses all the
     *      final instructions from the conflict block; an exception is when an opaque predicate in the conflicting block is no
     *      longer opaque in the new block.  Eventually if the new block is attached to the CFG/AUM then the conflict block
     *      will be truncated.  When there is no conflict block then this instruction becomes the final instruction of the
     *      basic block.
