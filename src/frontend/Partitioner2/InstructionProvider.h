/** Provides and caches instructions.
 *
 *  This class returns an instruction for a given address, caching the instruction so that the same instruction is returned
 *  each time the same address is specified.  If an instruction cannot be returned because it doesn't exist then a null pointer
 *  should be returned.  If an instruction cannot be disassembled at the specified address then an "unknown" instruction should
 *  be returned.
 *
 *  An instruction provider normally uses a supplied disassembler to obtain instructions that aren't in its cache.  However,
 *  the user can initialize the cache explicitly and turn off the ability to call a disassembler.  A disassembler is always
 *  required regardless of whether its used to obtain new instructions because the disassembler has the canonical information
 *  about the machine architecture: what registers are defined, which registers are the program counter and stack pointer,
 *  which instruction semantics dispatcher can be used with the instructions, etc. */
