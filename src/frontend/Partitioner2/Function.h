/** Describes one function.
 *
 *  A function consists of one or more basic blocks.  Exactly one block is special in that it serves as the entry point when
 *  this function is invoked from elsewhere; the only incoming inter-function edges are to this entry block.  This function may
 *  have outgoing inter-function edges that represent invocations of other functions, and the targets of all such edges will be
 *  the entry block of another function.  A function may also own zero or more data blocks consisting of a base address and
 *  size (type).
 *
 *  A function may exist as part of the partitioner's control flow graph, or in a detached state.  When a function is
 *  represented by the control flow graph then it is in a frozen state, meaning that its basic blocks and data blocks cannot be
 *  adjusted adjusted; one must use the partitioner interface to do so. */
