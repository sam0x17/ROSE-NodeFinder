/** Various tools for data flow analysis.
 *
 *  @section s1 Comparison with source code data flow
 *
 *  Binary data flow analysis differs from source code data flow analysis in that source code has well-known, named variables
 *  and the analysis is often simplified by considering only those variables (e.g., whole arrays, not array element
 *  granularity), and by ignoring aliasing issues.  But because binaries have no named variables but rather one large array of
 *  memory with computed addresses, a binary data flow analysis <em>must</em> be at address granularity and account for
 *  aliasing. In fact, because of the rich set of addressing modes, it is very common that within a single instruction some of
 *  the inputs and/or outputs depend on other inputs.  The binary data flow implemented by this class uses abstract locations
 *  (@ref AbstractLocation) to represent variables. An abstract location is either a register or a memory address.  Registers
 *  are represented by a @ref RegisterDescriptor while addresses are represented by a semantic value in some user-specified
 *  domain (often symbolic, see @ref rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics2::BaseSemantics::SValue).
 *
 *  Another difference is in the number of basic operations that need to be supported. Source-level languages typically have at
 *  most a few dozen basic operations for which data flow must be explicitly encoded in the analysis, while binary analysis
 *  needs basic data flow information about hundreds of CPU instructions across the supported architectures.  In fact, there
 *  are so many unique instructions that the implementation here takes a different approach:  it leverages the fact that ROSE
 *  has instruction semantics and is able to discern data flow within an instruction (or even across an entire basic block) by
 *  executing the instruction (or block) in a special data flow semantic domain.  The domain is an aggregate domain consisting
 *  of a main user-specified domain (often symbolic), a domain to track data flow, and any number of additional user-specified
 *  domains.  This approach works to discover multiple dataflow within the executed item (instruction or basic block); most CPU
 *  instructions have multiple data flows (e.g., "PUSH" has at least three independent data flows: incrementing of the
 *  instruction pointer, moving data between stack and register, incrementing the stack pointer).
 *
 *  Two additional minor things to be aware of in binary data flow are (1) the difference in size between registers and memory
 *  locations, and (2) the use of idioms to perform common tasks.  For instance, a read from memory to a 32-bit register is
 *  actually four separate 8-bit reads at the dataflow level since memory holds 8-bit values.  An example of an idiom is the
 *  "XOR EAX, EAX" instruction to set the EAX register to zero (this is important for taint analysis, since it effectively
 *  removes any taint from EAX).
 *
 *  @section s2 Prerequisites for the core data flow algorithm
 *
 *  Before the core data flow analysis can run (e.g., taint analysis) there needs to be a number of pieces of information
 *  available:
 *
 *  @li A control flow graph over the part of the specimen being analyzed (e.g., control flow over a function).  The vertices
 *      of the CFG can be either instructions or basic blocks (since a basic block is effectively a large instruction).
 *
 *  @li A lattice of values so that a value can be stored at each variable.  The values form a lattice so that the
 *      meet/join/merge function, when combining two values, always results in a value which is a common parent of the input
 *      values.
 *
 *  @li A state type that maps variables to values of the lattice.  The number of variables must be finite for the data flow
 *      analysis to reach a fixed point.
 * 
 *  @li A transfer function that uses the data flow information for the execution unit (instruction or basic block) to create a
 *      new state from an existing state.
 * 
 *  @li A merge function so that an input state can be computed for a CFG vertex when that vertex has multiple incoming control
 *      flow paths.
 * 
 *  @li A starting vertex in the CFG and its initial incoming state.
 *
 *  @section s3 Computing prerequisites
 *
 *  Obviously one needs to parse the ELF or PE container, locate and disassemble instructions, and optionally group those
 *  instructions into units on which the core data flow algorithm will operate (probably basic blocks and functions).  This is
 *  performed with the usual ROSE binary analysis mechanisms.
 *
 *  Once the scope of the analysis is determined (e.g., a particular function), a control flow graph is obtained with @ref
 *  rose::BinaryAnalysis::ControlFlow, which produces a CFG whose vertices are either instructions or basic blocks (user's
 *  choice). Any kind of graph supporting the Boost Graph Library (BGL) API is permissible if it also satisfies the
 *  requirements layed out in the ControlFlow documentation.
 *
 *  Data flow paths per CFG vertex need to be computed and made available to the transfer function.  The transfer function will
 *  use these paths when creating an output state from an input state.  The endpoints of each path are the variables, so this
 *  step also provides a list of all the variables that will appear in the data flow states.  One way to obtain this
 *  information is to use the DataFlowSemantics instruction semantics; another way is to call the @ref buildGraphPerVertex
 *  method.  The former method allows the user to choose the memory address domain; the latter uses the symbolic domain. In any
 *  case, @ref getUniqueVariables will return a list of variables.
 *
 *  @section s4 Core data flow engine
 *
 *  The core data flow engine uses the prerequisites mentioned above and traverses the CFG until the state converges to a fixed
 *  point. */

     *  @li @p CFG is the type for the control flow graph.  It must implement the Sawyer::Container::Graph API and have
     *      vertices that point to instructions (SgAsmInstruction) or basic blocks (SgAsmBlock).

     *      implement any particular ownership paradigm, the state pointer type is usually some kind of smart pointer.  The
     *      engine requires that the pointer have a copy constructor and assignment operator.
     *
     *  @li @p TransferFunction is a functor that is invoked at each CFG vertex to create a new data state from a previous
     *      data state.  The functor is called with three arguments: a const reference to the control flow graph, the CFG
     *      vertex ID for the vertex being processed, and the incoming state for that vertex.  The call should return a pointer
     *      to a new state.
