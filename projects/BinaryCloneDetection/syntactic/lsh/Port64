## Facts:
= could use "sizeof(long int)" to decide the machine's word size
  - can't be used in another macro def.
= On 32-bit machines, "long long int" may also be 64 bits.

## What changes should be made for 64-bit machines?
= type definitions for IntT, UnsT etc.
= some default values, e.g., MIN_INT, UH_PRIME_DEFAULT etc.
= usage of Int32T, Uns32T should be generic
= change "%d" to "%ld" in printf/scanf, etc.
= change "atoi" etc. to "atol"


## What to change in order to work on both 64 and 32 bit machines?
= a macro "MACHINE_WORD_SIZE" decides the number of bits.
= define generic int types
= define generic functions atoi/atol, floor/floorf/ etc.
= define generic format characters (%d/%ld)
