// This file implementes the Aterm API for use in ROSE, so that Aterm
// applications can seemlessly use ROSE ASTs as ATerms.   We will see 
// if this can be made to work...The similar support outlined in the 
// paper "Fusing a Transformation Language with an Open Compiler"
// took specific advantage of Java languages mechanisms that appears
// to have made this a much simpler job than it reduces to for the 
// C API that we are using within the DTEC project.
