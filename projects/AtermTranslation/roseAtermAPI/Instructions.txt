Instructions for how to compile sdf and stratedo with the ROSE implementation of the Aterm API:

1) First we have to build sdf, to do this run configure with --with-aterm set to the ROSE
   ATerm API:
   ./configure --with-aterm=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI --prefix=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/sdf2-bundle-2.4/sdf2-bundle-2.4-install-64bit


   Before doing this configure needs to see the pkgconfig/aterm.pc file and this is in the
        "projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI/lib"
   directory.  This file sets the prefix variable to point to the build tree of the ROSE
   ATerm API implementation.

   I want to clean this up later to make it easier to explain and use.



   After getting sdf to build, it was a problem to run "make install".
   I had to build symlinks of the Aterm library to:
      ln -s /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git-LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-edg4x-rc-aterm/projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git_LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-edg4x-rc-aterm_install/lib
   and then in the directory: 
      /home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git-LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-edg4x-rc-aterm/projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI
   run
      ln -s .libs/libATerm.so libATerm.so

   This allowed the libtool generate commands (to run gcc) to relink the libraries
   in the sdf install tree (which had been specified on the configure command line
   (above).

   At this point the sdf "make install" command ran and we had a instalation of SDF
   using our ROSE Aterm API.  

   On to Stratego...


2) Run the configure command for stratego:

configure --with-aterm=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git-LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-edg4x-rc-aterm/projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI --with-sdf=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/sdf2-bundle-2.4/sdf2-bundle-2.4-install-64bit --with-strategoxt=/home/dquinlan/bin/strategoxt-0.17-install-32bit --prefix=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/strategoxt-0.17/strategoxt-0.17-install-64bit

This I used the 64 bit version of strategoxt:
configure --with-aterm=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git-LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-edg4x-rc-aterm/projects/AtermTranslation/roseAtermAPI --with-sdf=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/sdf2-bundle-2.4/sdf2-bundle-2.4-install-64bit --with-strategoxt=/home/dquinlan/bin/strategoxt-0.17-install --prefix=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg4x-rc/projects/AtermTranslation/strategoxt-0.17/strategoxt-0.17-install-64bit

   Here I used the new SDF (from part 1) but I used the 32-bit version of strategoxt
   that was previously installed.  This got me through configure.
