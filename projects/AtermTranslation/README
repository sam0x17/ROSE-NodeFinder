Installing Aterm Library:
   The ATerm library is required within Stratego.
There is a patch to Aterm-2.8 (so likely this is the
best version to use).  Note that even without the
patch there is a bug in the installation of Stragego 
that only happens (for me) if you run make clean and
try to rerun make. It is:
   Making all in test
   ../utils/dicttoc -file-prefix terms -dict terms.dict
   gmake[1]: *** [terms.c] Segmentation fault
   gmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
   tux321.llnl.gov{dquinlan}6: 
However, if you install a freash version and only
run:
   configure --prefix=`pwd`
   patch patch -p1 < aterm.patch
   make
   make install

NOTE: this assumes that you have copied the aterm.patch that 
is required for use of aterms with stratego into the top level
aterm-2.8 directory.

ROSE must then be configured to use the Aterm library.
    --with-aterm

To avoid the bug in the rebuilding we can edit the test/Makefile.in 
(at the bottom) to be:

.dict.c:
#  Edited out to avoid rebuiding error.
#	${top_builddir}/utils/dicttoc -file-prefix $* -dict $<
	touch terms.c
	touch terms.h

Note that editing the Makefile.am file has no effect since it
in not possible to rerun automake (strange version error with 
aclocal.m4).


Installation directions for Aterm use with ROSE:
   1) Location of Aterm work in ROSE: ROSE/projects/AtermTranslation

   2) Example of configure line:
/home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-edg49-rc/configure --with-C_OPTIMIZE=no --with-CXX_OPTIMIZE=no --with-ROSE_LONG_MAKE_CHECK_RULE=yes --prefix=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git_LINUX-64bit-4.4.7-dq-edg49-using-edg47-rc_install --with-boost=/nfs/casc/overture/ROSE/opt/rhel6/x86_64/boost/1_45_0/gcc/4.4.7 --with-aterm=/home/dquinlan/bin/aterm-2.5-install-64bit
