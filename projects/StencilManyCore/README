Use case 1:

To run the generator:
  $ ./pcg stencil-gen.pt  < input.cpp  > output.cpp

Input file: input.cpp
output file: output.cpp

The output code (output.cpp) can be compiled but cannot be run because input.code does not have a main function.

Use case 2: testPermutations.C from the ROSE/project directory

To run the generator:
  $ ./pcg stencil-gen.pt < testPermutations.C > testPermutations2.C
  
  Here a pragma had been inserted into the testPermutations.C file to convert the stencil operation (high-level) to the POET generated stencil code.
 
  I have compiled both testPermutations.C and testPermutations2.C using g++, and both programs can run. The output by POET seems to run much faster.
