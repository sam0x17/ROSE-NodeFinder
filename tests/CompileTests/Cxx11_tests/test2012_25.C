// Multithreading memory model
// See also: Memory model (computing)

// The C++11 standardizes support for multithreaded programming.

// There are two parts involved: a memory model which allows multiple threads to co-exist in a program and 
// library support for interaction between threads. (See this article's section on threading facilities.)

// The memory model defines when multiple threads may access the same memory location, and specifies when 
// updates by one thread become visible to other threads.

// This is a library issue independent of the langauge.
