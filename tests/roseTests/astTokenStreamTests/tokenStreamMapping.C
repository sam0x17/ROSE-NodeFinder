/*
// This file supports the new parse tree support in ROSE.
// specifically this is a "Concrete Syntax Augmented AST"
// Because the ROSE IR is close to that of the C/C++/Fortran 
// grammar the parse tree can be derived from the token stream
// and the AST.  The principal representation of the CSA AST
// is a map using the IR nodes of the AST as keys into the map
// and the map elements being a data structure (TokenStreamSequenceToNodeMapping)
// containing three pairs of indexes representing the subsequence 
// of tokens for the leading tokens (often white space), the token
// subsequence for the AST IR node (including its subtree), and
// the trailing token subsequence (often white space).

// So where the AST might be:
//        SgWhileStmt
//        /        \
// SgStatement  SgStatement
// (predicate)    (body)
//
// The associated parse tree would be:
//
//              SgWhileStmt
//        /  /      \      \      \
// "while" "(" SgStatement  ")" SgStatement
//               (predicate)      (body)
//
// (so much for ASCI art).
//

// We have a number of ways that we expect could be a problem for this 
// token stream mapping (possible failure modes):
//   1) Toky() macro to write code (not working yet)
//   2) Token pasting operator ## (WORKS)
//   3) Use equivalent of generated binary as a test for generate source code 
//      that is equivalent to the input file up to the use of new lines and other 
//      white space (THIS IS NOT A GREAT TEST (unless the filename of the generated 
//      code is made the same)).
//   4) Use multiple variable names in the same variable declaration (FIXED).
//
// Each of these are being addressed before moving this code into ROSE,
// merging it with the Wave support, and modifying the unparser to 
// use the token stream support.
