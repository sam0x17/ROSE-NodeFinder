// Test cases for if-stmt
// if-stmt is the innermost scope  in the scope tree
//  Two cases:
//  1. var decl can be further moved into true and false branch bodies
//      treat it as normal innermost common scope with multiple scopes
//  2. var decl cannot be moved further
//      if-stmt is the innermost scope to be inserted into. Must adjust to a higher level scope instead.
// used in multiple branches, can be moved
#include <stdio.h>

void foo(int cond, int* blockx, int loSt)
{
  int tmp ;

  // if-stmt , eligible to move into two branches
  if (cond) 
  { tmp = 6; printf("%d", tmp) ; }
  else 
  { tmp = 7 ; printf("%d", tmp) ; }  


  // another if-stmt case
  // variable is used in both true and false body
  // But not eligible to move into two bodies
  // Naive analysis will find if-stmt is the inner-most common scope.
