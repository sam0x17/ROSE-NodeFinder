The "rose.h" header file should not be included into any ROSE library header
files.  Include "sage3basic.h" in the ROSE library .C file before including
the header file instead.

The "sage3.h" and "sage3basic.h" header files should not be included into any
ROSE library header file because they pollute the user's global namespace with
preprocessor symbols that don't begin with "ROSE_".  Instead, you may include
these files into ROSE library .C files before including the ROSE library header
file as long as the header will behave correctly in user code when a user
first includes <rose.h>.

The "rose_config.h" header should not be included into any ROSE library header
file because it pollutes the user's global namespace with preprocessor symobls
that don't begin with "ROSE_".  If the header needs configuration symbols then
include <rosePublicConfig.h> into the header instead; otherwise include
"rose_config.h" into the ROSE library .C file instead.

The following files violate this policy:
